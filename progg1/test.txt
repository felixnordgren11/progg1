These lecture notes are intended for the course “Symmetry and Group Theory in Physics,”
given in the master program in physics at Uppsala University. The course consists of three
parts: the first part is about general group theory and the theory of representations, and
mostly deals with finite groups. The second part deals with discrete groups and applications
in condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics. The third part is concerned with
continuous groups (i.e. Lie groups) and Lie algebras, and their applications in (mostly)
nuclear and particle physics and special relativity.
These notes are so far intended to cover the first and third parts of the course. The focus
in the first part is on the structure of groups in general and on their representations. The
focus of the third part is on the Lie algebras associated with Lie groups. The SU(2) and
SU(3) groups and algebras are discussed in detail, and the Cartan–Weyl basis and Dynkin
classification are introduced. There is also a chapter about the Lorentz and Poincare groups,
and I briefly discuss the extension of the Poincare algebra to supersymmetry.
